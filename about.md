I am Nick Halmagyi, theoretical physicist, programmer and temperamental hobbiest. 
I'm pretty cautious about putting private stuff online, so this site is really just about stuff 
I find interesting in science and tech....and sheesh, there's so much! My interests have shifted 
from black holes and strings to programming and machine learning, perhaps it's my narrow training but
machine learning seems to me to be statistical physics under another name. Supersymmetric neural net anyone? oh dear....

If I  didn't have science to keep me occupied, 
I'd probably be surfing and playing mah geetah, a fairly run of the mill cliche for an Australian guy!
